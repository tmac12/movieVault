## 2026-02-02: US-001 - Add GetMovieByID method to TMDB client

### What was done:
- Added `GetMovieByID(tmdbID int) (*writer.Movie, error)` method to `internal/metadata/tmdb.go`
- Method directly calls TMDB `/movie/{id}` endpoint (via existing `GetMovieDetails`) bypassing search
- Fetches credits via existing `GetMovieCredits` call
- Returns fully populated `*writer.Movie` struct matching `GetFullMovieData` output format
- Added `ErrMovieNotFound` sentinel error for proper 404 handling
- Fixed pre-existing lint issue in `cmd/scanner/main.go` (redundant newline in fmt.Println)

### Files modified:
- `internal/metadata/tmdb.go` - Added GetMovieByID method and ErrMovieNotFound error
- `cmd/scanner/main.go` - Fixed lint issue (unrelated to US-001 but blocked tests)

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes

### Notes for next developer:
- US-002 is the logical next step - it will integrate GetMovieByID into the scanner's NFO processing flow
- The method reuses existing GetMovieDetails and GetMovieCredits methods to maintain consistency
- ErrMovieNotFound can be checked with `errors.Is(err, metadata.ErrMovieNotFound)` for fallback logic

## 2026-02-02: US-002 - Use TMDB ID from NFO for direct lookup

### What was done:
- Modified `cmd/scanner/main.go` to use direct TMDB ID lookup when NFO contains a valid TMDBID
- Added `errors` import for proper sentinel error checking
- When NFO contains TMDBID > 0, calls `GetMovieByID` instead of `GetFullMovieData`
- If `GetMovieByID` returns 404 error (checked via `errors.Is(err, metadata.ErrMovieNotFound)`), falls back to title/year search
- If TMDBID is 0 or missing, uses existing title/year search behavior
- Added verbose logging for TMDB lookup method ("direct ID", "search", "search (fallback from direct)")

### Files modified:
- `cmd/scanner/main.go` - Added TMDB ID direct lookup integration with NFO processing

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes
- Note: npm typecheck/test not available in website - environmental esbuild ARM64 compatibility issue unrelated to Go code changes

### Notes for next developer:
- US-003 (Add retry package with exponential backoff) is the next logical step
- The direct lookup improves metadata accuracy by avoiding title search ambiguity when TMDB ID is known
- Verbose mode now shows which lookup method was used for debugging
- The mergeMovieData function is still used to combine NFO data with TMDB data (NFO takes priority)

## 2026-02-02: US-003 - Add retry package with exponential backoff

### What was done:
- Created `internal/retry/retry.go` package with reusable retry utility
- Implemented `Retry(fn func() error, maxAttempts int, initialBackoff time.Duration) error`
  - Executes function with exponential backoff until success or maxAttempts reached
  - Backoff doubles after each failed attempt
  - Rate-limited errors (429) use 2x longer backoff
  - Non-retryable errors (401, 404) return immediately without retry
- Implemented `IsRetryable(err error) bool` helper that returns true for:
  - `net.Error` timeouts (via `errors.As`)
  - `url.Error` timeouts (via `errors.As`)
  - HTTP 5xx status codes (500, 501, 502, 503, 504)
  - Common transient error messages (connection reset, connection refused, no such host, i/o timeout, temporary failure)
- Implemented `IsRateLimited(err error) bool` helper that returns true for HTTP 429 errors

### Files created:
- `internal/retry/retry.go` - New retry package with exponential backoff

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes
- Note: npm build has esbuild ARM64 compatibility issue unrelated to Go code changes

### Notes for next developer:
- US-004 (Add retry config options) is the next logical step - it will add config struct fields
- US-005 will then integrate this retry logic into the TMDB client
- The retry package uses error string matching for HTTP status codes since TMDB client wraps errors with fmt.Errorf
- Consider adding structured error types in future for better error classification

## 2026-02-02: US-004 - Add retry config options

### What was done:
- Added `RetryConfig` struct to `internal/config/config.go` with two fields:
  - `MaxAttempts int` (yaml: `max_attempts`)
  - `InitialBackoffMs int` (yaml: `initial_backoff_ms`)
- Added `Retry` field to main `Config` struct
- Added default values in `Load()` function:
  - `MaxAttempts` defaults to 3
  - `InitialBackoffMs` defaults to 1000
- Updated `config/config.example.yaml` with retry section and descriptive comments

### Files modified:
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added RetryConfig struct and defaults
- `config/config.example.yaml` - Added retry section with documentation

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes

### Notes for next developer:
- US-005 (Integrate retry logic into TMDB client) is the next logical step
- The config values can be accessed via `cfg.Retry.MaxAttempts` and `cfg.Retry.InitialBackoffMs`
- Convert `InitialBackoffMs` to `time.Duration` when passing to retry.Retry(): `time.Duration(cfg.Retry.InitialBackoffMs) * time.Millisecond`
- The TMDB client will need to accept config or retry parameters to use these values

## 2026-02-02: US-005 - Integrate retry logic into TMDB client

### What was done:
- Added `doRequestWithRetry(requestURL string) (*http.Response, error)` helper method to TMDB client
  - Wraps HTTP GET requests with `retry.Retry()` from the retry package
  - Handles both network errors and HTTP status codes (5xx, 429)
  - Logs retry attempts via callback when provided
  - Rate-limited (429) errors use double backoff
- Added `RetryLogFunc` type for verbose logging callback
- Added `ClientConfig` struct with full configuration options:
  - `APIKey`, `Language`, `RateLimitDelayMs`
  - `MaxAttempts`, `InitialBackoffMs`
  - `RetryLogFunc` callback
- Added `NewClientWithConfig(cfg ClientConfig) *Client` constructor
- Updated existing `NewClient()` to delegate to `NewClientWithConfig()` with defaults
- Wrapped HTTP calls in `SearchMovie`, `GetMovieDetails`, `GetMovieCredits`, and `DownloadImage` with retry logic
- Updated `cmd/scanner/main.go` to use `NewClientWithConfig()` with retry config from loaded configuration
- Added verbose mode logging callback that logs retry attempts with attempt number, max attempts, backoff duration, and error

### Files modified:
- `internal/metadata/tmdb.go` - Added retry integration, ClientConfig, NewClientWithConfig, doRequestWithRetry
- `cmd/scanner/main.go` - Updated to use NewClientWithConfig with retry config and verbose logging

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes

### Notes for next developer:
- US-006 (Create SQLite cache package) is the next logical step
- The retry logic is now fully integrated - all TMDB API calls will automatically retry on transient failures
- Verbose mode (`--verbose` flag) will show retry attempts in the log output
- The `NewClient()` function is preserved for backward compatibility with default retry settings (3 attempts, 1000ms initial backoff)

## 2026-02-02: US-006 - Create SQLite cache package

### What was done:
- Created `internal/metadata/cache/cache.go` with `Cache` interface defining:
  - `Get(key string) ([]byte, bool)` - retrieves data from cache
  - `Set(key string, data []byte, ttl time.Duration) error` - stores data with TTL
  - `Clear() error` - removes all entries
  - `Close() error` - closes the cache and releases resources
- Created `internal/metadata/cache/sqlite.go` with `SQLiteCache` implementation:
  - Uses `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` driver for SQLite persistence
  - Schema: `id` (autoincrement), `cache_key` (unique), `response_json` (blob), `cached_at`, `expires_at`
  - Indexes on `cache_key` and `expires_at` for performance
  - `NewSQLiteCache(dbPath string)` auto-creates database file and table on first use
  - Get() returns cached data if found and not expired, deletes expired entries on access
  - Set() uses INSERT OR REPLACE to handle both new entries and updates
  - Clear() deletes all rows from cache table
- Added `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 v1.14.33` dependency to go.mod

### Files created:
- `internal/metadata/cache/cache.go` - Cache interface
- `internal/metadata/cache/sqlite.go` - SQLiteCache implementation

### Files modified:
- `go.mod` - Added go-sqlite3 dependency
- `go.sum` - Updated with go-sqlite3 checksums

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes

### Notes for next developer:
- US-007 (Add cache config options) is the next logical step - adds Enabled, Path, and TTLDays config fields
- US-008 will then integrate the cache into the TMDB client
- The cache uses TTL-based expiration checked on Get() - expired entries are deleted when accessed
- The SQLiteCache requires explicit Close() call to release database connection
- Parent directory for database file is auto-created if it doesn't exist

## 2026-02-02: US-007 - Add cache config options

### What was done:
- Added `CacheConfig` struct to `internal/config/config.go` with three fields:
  - `Enabled bool` (yaml: `enabled`)
  - `Path string` (yaml: `path`)
  - `TTLDays int` (yaml: `ttl_days`)
- Added `Cache` field to main `Config` struct
- Added default values in `Load()` function:
  - `Enabled` defaults to true (when cache section not provided)
  - `Path` defaults to `./data/cache.db`
  - `TTLDays` defaults to 30
- Updated `config/config.example.yaml` with cache section and descriptive comments

### Files modified:
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added CacheConfig struct and defaults
- `config/config.example.yaml` - Added cache section with documentation

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes

### Notes for next developer:
- US-008 (Integrate cache into TMDB client) is the next logical step
- The config values can be accessed via `cfg.Cache.Enabled`, `cfg.Cache.Path`, and `cfg.Cache.TTLDays`
- Convert TTLDays to `time.Duration` when passing to cache.Set(): `time.Duration(cfg.Cache.TTLDays) * 24 * time.Hour`
- The default behavior enables caching - users must explicitly set `enabled: false` to disable
- If user provides cache section with `enabled: false` and custom path, that is respected

## 2026-02-02: US-008 - Integrate cache into TMDB client

### What was done:
- Added cache integration to TMDB client (`internal/metadata/tmdb.go`):
  - Added `CacheLogFunc` type for verbose logging of cache operations
  - Added cache-related fields to `Client` struct: `cache`, `cacheTTL`, `cacheLogFunc`, `forceRefresh`
  - Added cache-related fields to `ClientConfig`: `Cache`, `CacheTTLDays`, `CacheLogFunc`, `ForceRefresh`
  - Added `getFromCache(key string)` helper that checks cache (respects forceRefresh flag)
  - Added `setToCache(key string, data []byte)` helper that stores data in cache
  - Integrated cache into `SearchMovie()` with key format `tmdb:search:{title}:{year}`
  - Integrated cache into `GetMovieDetails()` with key format `tmdb:movie:{tmdbID}`
  - Integrated cache into `GetMovieCredits()` with key format `tmdb:credits:{tmdbID}`
- Updated `cmd/scanner/main.go`:
  - Initialize SQLiteCache when `cfg.Cache.Enabled` is true
  - Added `cacheLogFunc` callback for verbose logging (hit/miss/store operations)
  - Pass cache, TTL, log func, and forceRefresh flag to TMDB client via `ClientConfig`
  - Properly close cache on exit via `defer tmdbCache.Close()`

### Files modified:
- `internal/metadata/tmdb.go` - Added cache integration with helper methods and updated API methods
- `cmd/scanner/main.go` - Initialize cache, pass to TMDB client, add verbose logging

### Cache key format:
- Search: `tmdb:search:{title}:{year}` (e.g., `tmdb:search:The Matrix:1999`)
- Movie details: `tmdb:movie:{tmdbID}` (e.g., `tmdb:movie:603`)
- Credits: `tmdb:credits:{tmdbID}` (e.g., `tmdb:credits:603`)

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes
- Note: Website has no typecheck/test npm scripts configured

### Notes for next developer:
- US-009 (Add --clear-cache CLI flag) is the next logical step
- The cache is skipped when `--force-refresh` flag is used (set via `ForceRefresh` in ClientConfig)
- Cache operations are logged in verbose mode (--verbose flag) via the CacheLogFunc callback
- The cache TTL is converted from days to `time.Duration` in `NewClientWithConfig()`
- If cache initialization fails, the scanner exits with error code 1
- Image downloads (DownloadImage) are NOT cached since they go directly to files

## 2026-02-02: US-009 - Add --clear-cache CLI flag

### What was done:
- Added `--clear-cache` flag to `cmd/scanner/main.go`
- When flag is set:
  1. Opens the SQLite cache at the configured path
  2. Counts existing entries using new `Count()` method
  3. Clears all entries via `cache.Clear()`
  4. Prints confirmation message with number of entries removed
  5. Exits with code 0 on success
- Exits with code 1 on any error (failed to open cache, count, or clear)
- Gracefully handles disabled cache configuration (prints message and exits 0)
- Added `Count() (int, error)` method to `Cache` interface in `internal/metadata/cache/cache.go`
- Implemented `Count()` in `SQLiteCache` using `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cache`

### Files modified:
- `cmd/scanner/main.go` - Added --clear-cache flag and handling logic
- `internal/metadata/cache/cache.go` - Added Count() method to Cache interface
- `internal/metadata/cache/sqlite.go` - Implemented Count() method for SQLiteCache

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes
- Note: Website has no typecheck/test npm scripts configured

### Notes for next developer:
- US-010 (Title extraction - remove resolution markers) is the next logical step
- The --clear-cache flag is handled early in main() after config loading but before scanning
- Count() is called before Clear() to report how many entries were removed
- If cache is disabled in config, the flag just prints a message and exits successfully

## 2026-02-02: US-010 - Title extraction - remove resolution markers

### What was done:
- Added `resolutionPattern` regex to `internal/scanner/patterns.go`
  - Pattern: `(?i)\b(2160p|1080p|1080i|720p|720i|480p|4K)\b`
  - Case-insensitive matching via `(?i)` flag
  - Matches all required resolutions: 2160p, 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 720i, 480p, 4K
- Separated resolution patterns from source quality patterns for clarity
  - `resolutionPattern` - resolution markers only
  - `qualityPattern` - source markers (BluRay, WEB-DL, etc.)
- **Critical fix**: Resolution markers must be removed BEFORE year extraction
  - The year pattern `[\[\(]?(\d{4})[\]\)]?` was matching "1080" in "1080p" as a year
  - This left orphan "p" characters in titles (e.g., "Movie p" instead of "Movie")
  - Moving resolution removal before year extraction prevents this issue

### Files modified:
- `internal/scanner/patterns.go` - Added resolutionPattern, reordered processing

### Test cases verified:
- `Movie.2020.1080p.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.720p.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.2160p.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.4K.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.480p.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.1080i.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.720i.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `The.Matrix.1999.1080p.BluRay.mkv` -> Title: 'The Matrix', Year: 1999 ✓

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes

### Notes for next developer:
- US-011 (Title extraction - remove source markers) is the next logical step
- The qualityPattern already contains some source markers but US-011 expands the list
- Keep the pattern ordering: resolution → year → quality → codec → audio → etc.
- Pattern order matters because year extraction can match 4-digit numbers in other patterns

## 2026-02-02: US-011 - Title extraction - remove source markers

### What was done:
- Expanded `qualityPattern` regex in `internal/scanner/patterns.go`
  - Previous pattern: `BluRay|BDRip|WEB-DL|WEBRip|HDRip|DVDRip|HDTV`
  - New pattern: `BluRay|BRRip|WEB-DL|WEBRip|HDRip|DVDRip|HDTV|BDRip|WEB|AMZN|NF`
  - Added missing markers: BRRip, WEB, AMZN, NF
  - BDRip was already present in the original pattern
- Pattern remains case-insensitive via `(?i)` flag
- Added US-011 comment to identify the change

### Files modified:
- `internal/scanner/patterns.go` - Expanded qualityPattern with additional source markers

### Test cases verified (pattern matching):
- `Movie.2020.BluRay.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.BRRip.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.WEB-DL.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.WEBRip.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.AMZN.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.NF.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓
- `Movie.2020.WEB.mkv` -> Title: 'Movie', Year: 2020 ✓

### Verification:
- `go build ./...` - passes
- `go test ./...` - passes (no test files exist yet)
- `go vet ./...` - passes
- Note: Website has no typecheck/test npm scripts configured

### Notes for next developer:
- US-012 (Title extraction - remove codec markers) is the next logical step
- The codecPattern already exists but should be verified against US-012 requirements
- Keep pattern ordering: resolution → year → quality → codec → audio → etc.
